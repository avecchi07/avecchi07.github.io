	<p>Winter, who was saved off the coast of Florida, was found in 2005 caught in a dangerous crab trap rope that eventually led to the amputation of her tail. This story became the most inspirational story, resulting in 2 movies and a foundation that provides research and ways to help the tailless dolphin swim and live happily and healthy. This research provided a new and unique prosthetic tail for Winter to swim safely and freely. This unfortunate but miracle of a situation showed the world the amazing works and studies of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium team, with the help and fundraising of people from all over the globe. The Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, Florida is home of many of endangered and sick marine life found off the coasts. Their mission in everything is “Rescue, Rehab and Release”. They make it their point to rescue an animal, take care of them until they are able to live in the ocean on their own and survive. They do not keep animals unless they are unable to survive by themselves in the open ocean.</p>
	<p>What the world doesn’t realize is how much our actions here on land are affecting the animals in the ocean. Their shelters, food and their lives are being destroyed each year by pollution. “One in three leatherback sea turtles have plastic in their stomach, most often a plastic bag” says Eco Watch. These sea animals are getting hurt and killed by doing nothing wrong. I have always loved the ocean and all of the unique and amazing animals living below it. Reading and learning about all the awful events happening that ruin these waters is heart breaking and motivates me to want to help. After college, I plan to be part of the change and volunteer to help rescue and take care of these sick and endangered animals under the sea. Seeing these animals with ruined environments and in danger make me want to do as much as I can to help them.</p>
<p>	 Companies these days are doing everything the most cost efficient way, but that doesn’t mean it’s the best or least harmful way. When disposing of wastes, these people are using the cheap and convenient way, which is dumping it in the ocean. Not thinking anything of the life that lives below these waters, wastes such as sewage, trash, debris, radioactive wastes and so much more harmful chemicals are dumped and left in the waters for animals to eat and live in. There are at least 400 dead zones all around the world, meaning a place where animals are unable to live and survive. These dead zones are caused by the wastes and pollution dumped into the oceans every day. These chemicals are ruining the ocean environment and making marine life unable to survive without dying of toxic materials. While catching fish, lobster, crabs and many more, fishermen don’t often clean up their nets and cages afterward. These materials left behind are catching animals it shouldn’t, such as sea turtles and seals. Many animals are getting heads and fins stuck in cages, making them at risk for drowning or losing a limb. Used nets floating in the ocean are getting tangled up on marine life, endangering them.  In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, there is an island of garbage and wastes twice the size of Texas. That’s 537,640 miles! Not only are people physically destroying the ocean, they can do it by sound waves also. National Geographic founded that loud noises and horns from building, ships and cargos can and do disrupt the “migration, communication, hunting and reproduction patterns of many marine animals”. Even though there are rules and laws against these things, does that mean that people still follow them?</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, the largest source of pollution is coming directly from us here on land. National Geographic found that “Many ocean pollutants are released into the environment far upstream from coastlines”. Once an animal from the bottom of the food chain digests these chemicals, larger animals then eat those contaminated prey also ingesting these chemicals. This could go on and on until the top of the food chain and hurt, no kill them. These chemicals could even get to us by contaminated seafood and fish that we eat. Conserve Energy Future has studied that toxic metals that are dumped into the ocean are “destroying biochemistry, behavior, reproduction and growth”. Marine life can’t do anything themselves to fix this problem that they aren’t even causing. Conserve Energy Future brought together that “Three hundred thousand dolphins and porpoises die each year as a result of becoming entangled in discarded fishing nets, among other items. One hundred thousand sea mammals are killed in the ocean by pollution each year”. The ocean is the roof over their heads. The start and end of all of these dangerous and fatal problems to these animals start and end with us. Imagine someone coming into your room and destroying it, making it fatal and destructive, just because of laziness and not caring.</p>
	<p>Donating to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium would help the animals that are being hurt and unfortunately killed by these chemicals and wastes. By donating to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, you can adopt one of their marine lives such as sea turtles, dolphins and otters.Currently their main mission right now is to help secure and rescue the cold-stunned sea turtles.This means that the weather outside is too cold for them to survive and function. Another inspirational marine life is stubby, a female green sea turtle. This sea turtle was found in 2001, entangled in fishing lines and nets. She also suffers from a buoyancy disorder, meaning that she cannot float and stay up in the water the way she should. When she was found, her front two flippers were already missing, hence the name Stubby. With the help and care she got from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, she is the happiest turtle, even though she goes through many struggles with only 2 flippers. There are many advantages that this aquarium brings to the public such as visits with the special needs children and adults and Winter. They use the donations and the money from admissions to help make and keep these hurt marine animals alive. It would only make sense that the thing causing these problems would help fix the problems, even just little.</p></body>
