I may be going into accounting, but my true passion in life is sea turtles and just the marine life in general. It is such an underated topic, but they are in trouble and it is all because of us.</p>
<p>
My interest in this started when I first saw the movie Dolphin Tale when it came out in 2011. Ever since then I have been one of those crazy people that yells at poeple to pick up their trash on the beach. To read more about all of the harm this does, I wrote a paper in my sophmore year of high school about this topic so check it out!
